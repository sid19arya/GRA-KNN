# GRA-KNN
Exploration of a new Supervised Learning ML ALgorithm (modification of K-Nearest Neighbours)

The src repository includes the implementation of several dimensionality reduction techniques. The new algorithm proposed by us is implemented in the GRA and batchGRA python files. 
It should be noted that those 2 files particularly take an ** INCREDIBLY** long time to run. This is because the approach has not yet been vectorized and could stil improve a lot. Other files
include running KNN and weightedKNN after using PCA and feature selection through information gain for dimensionality reduction. 

The src/archive folder has a bunch of notebooks that we were using throughout the development process to improve our models and try our new things, they are very disorganized but feel free to take a look.
